<h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<div class="Section-2">
<p>Hello! My name is Erin Tisbury.</p>

<p>I've been married to my best friend for 17 years now. We have 5 kids together and I homeschool them. 
  My life is sweet chaos and I feel like I am always trying to figure out what to cook. I love to laugh and make memories with the people I do life with.
  I am a sinner saved by grace and I pray that the Lord would use this simple life of mine for His glory and His good.  
</p>

<p> As a proud member of Gen X, I've had to learn to adapt to technology and make it part of my everyday life. *The Nokia 
  with "snake" was my first cell phone so that should date me pretty well! Haha!* I've always been good with computers and figuring 
  things out. I remember learning to use our giant desktop "Dell" that took up the entire desk so I could get on AOL! 
  I decided to try coding and web development as a way to make some extra money. When I started it was a little overwhelming and I thought it would take
  years to get to the point where I was actually making things. But after a couple weeks of Udemy I'm already creating this!
</p>

<p>
    I am starting to learn the concepts and can only hope to improve on them with time. I am encouraged to keep working and to keep adding to my portfolio.
  Thank you for reading about me. If you like the things in my portfolio and need any work done let me know!
</p>
